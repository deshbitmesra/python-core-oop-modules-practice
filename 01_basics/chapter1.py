from charset_normalizer.utils import is_punctuation

# print("my name is: " + name)

#basic input and output in python
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("You have entered: " + name)

#ex1: Print your name using the print() function.
# my_name = input("Enter your name again : ")
# print("You have entered your name as:" + my_name)

#ex2: Create three variables: one for your name, one for your age, and one boolean to indicate if you're a student.

# name = "ramesh k"
# age = 28
# is_student = True
#
# print("is ramesh a student : ", is_student)
# print("is ramesh a student : "+  str(is_student))
# print("age is : " + str(age))


#ex3: Write a Python program that asks the user for their favorite color and prints it back

# color = input("tell me your favourite color  : ")
# print("your fav colour is : ", color)

# ex 4 : Identify the data type of: "Hello", 10, 3.5, True.

# greeting ="Hello"
# code = 10
# length = 3.5
# done = True
#
# print("type of greeting : ",  type(greeting))
# print("type of code : ", type(code))
# print("type of length", type(length))
#
# #using literals
# print(type("Hello"))
# print(type(10))
# print(type(3.5))
# print(type(True))

#Ex 5 : Write comments to describe what each line of this code does:

# #taking input from user for name
# name = input("Enter name: ")
#
# #print the value of name
# print("Hi", name)\

#Ex 6 : try using a variable before assigning it a value. What happens?
#print("age: " + age)  #NameError: name 'age' is not defined
#print("sex : ", sex) #NameError: name 'sex' is not defined. Did you mean: 'hex'?


#Ex 7 : Modify this code to use your own information:
# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# print(name, age)
# print("name : ", name, "age : ", age)

#Ex 8 : What will this print?
# a = 5
# b = 3
# print("a + b =  ", (a + b))

#Ex 9 : Accept two numbers from the user and print their sum.

# x = int(input("enter the value of x : "))
# y = int(input("Enter the value of y : "))
#
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
#
# print("x = ", x)
# print("y = ", y)
# #print("x + y = ", (int(x) + int(y)))
#
# print("x + y = ", x+y)

#Ex 10 : Write a program to take your birth year and calculate your age (assume the current year is 2025).

# birth_year = 1990
# current_year = 2025
# print("age = ", 2025 - 1990)

## Feedback implementation
#f-strings for formatting
# name = "desh deepak"
# print(f"name is {name}")

# #using string capitalize
# print(f"name is {name.capitalize()}")
